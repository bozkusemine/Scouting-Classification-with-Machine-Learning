# Scouting-Classification-with-Machine-Learning

Scouting classification with machine learning involves using machine learning algorithms to classify players based on their potential as a professional athlete. This can be done by training a machine learning model on a dataset of players that includes features such as their physical attributes, performance statistics, and other relevant characteristics. The model can then be used to predict the likelihood that a player will be successful at the professional level based on these features.
